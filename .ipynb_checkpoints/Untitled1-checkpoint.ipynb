    "## Machine Learning Model for Cyberattack Detection and Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors:** Conner Jordan, Matt Perona, Nathan Nawrocki\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of our project is to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying and classifying various types of cyberattacks using the Incribo synthetic cybersecurity dataset. By leveraging both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, we aim to build a system that not only recognizes known attack signatures but also detects anomalies indicative of potential zero-day attacks. This project will enhance our understanding of cybersecurity threats and contribute to the development of more robust defense mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is the Incribo synthetic cyber dataset from Kaggle, which consists of 25 varied metrics and 40,000 records. The dataset simulates real-world cyberattack scenarios and includes metrics such as timestamps, IP addresses, ports, protocols, packet lengths, malware indicators, anomaly scores, and more.\n",
